# assignment-10


## Due Date: 11/28 11:59pm

## Guidelines:

### 1. Task:

Student #1: First, complete Part 1 in Person1.ipynb. Second, wait for Student #2 to complete Part 1 in Person2.ipynb. Third, complete Part 2 in Person2.ipynb.

Student #2: First, complete Part 1 in Person2.ipynb. Second, wait for Student #1 to complete Part 1 in Person1.ipynb. Third, complete Part 2 in Person1.ipynb.

### 2. Github Workflow:

You are expected to use Github workflow (GH) to complete the assignment. 

First, make sure to push your jupyter notebook (i.e., Person1.ipynb or Person2.ipynb) to GH after you complete Part 1. 

Second, make sure to pull your partner's jupyter notebook before you start to update the file. 

Third, coordinate with your partner to avoid conflict in file editing (i.e., editing the same file at the same time). 

Fourth, points will be taken off if the team fails to use GH properly in the collaboration. 

### 3. Grading and Bonus:

The grade of this homeowork will be assigned to an entire team. The score will be computed by averaging the individual scores of the Person1.ipynb and Person2.ipynb. 

Your grade on Part 1 will depend on how many test cases have been passed using your code. Please make sure that your output matches the expected output **EXACTLY**. There will be bonus for Part 1, based on how many test cases you passed for questions in Part 1.

For example, 12 testcases are desgined for question 1. 
To receive full score, you are expected to pass at least 10 test cases. 
If you passed all 12 testcases, you will receive 20% extra credit. 
If you passed 9 or less testcases, you will be deducted by 10% or more for question 1.
