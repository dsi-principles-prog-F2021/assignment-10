## Due Date: 11/28 11:59pm

## Guidelines:

### 1. What to finish:

Person 1: Finish Part 1 in Person1.ipynb. After Person 2 has finished Part 1 in Person2.ipynb, finish Part 2 in Person2.ipynb.

Person 2: Finish Part 1 in Person2.ipynb. After Person 1 has finished Part 1 in Person1.ipynb, finish Part 2 in Person1.ipynb.

### 2. Github Workflow:

You are expected to use the Github workflow correctly. Make sure to push your work to GH after you finish it. Make sure to pull your partner's work before you are making updates to your partner's file. Do not edit on the same file at the same time. Although there is no points counted for using GH workflow correctly, major mistakes on using GH will lead to points deduction. 

### 3. Grading and Bonus:

The grade of this homeowork will be average score of two notebooks. 

Gradings on Part 1 will be using testcases. Make sure your output match the expected output **EXACTLY**. There will be bonus for Part 1, based on how many testcases you passed for questions in Part 1. 
For example, I might provide 12 test cases for question 1, but you are only expected to pass 10 of them to receive full score. If you passed all 12 testcases, you will receive 20% extra credit. If you passed 9 testcases, you will be deducted by 10% for question 1.
